## Dense Layer vs. Hidden Layer in Deep Learning

In deep learning, the terms "dense layer" and "hidden layer" are related but not exactly the same.

- **Dense Layer**: 
  - A dense layer, also known as a fully connected layer, is a layer where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. 
  - This type of layer is common in many neural network architectures, particularly in feedforward networks.

- **Hidden Layer**:
  - A hidden layer refers to any layer in a neural network that lies between the input and output layers.
  - It is called "hidden" because it is not directly exposed to the inputs or the outputs. 
  - Hidden layers can consist of various types of layers, such as dense (fully connected), convolutional, recurrent, etc.

So, while a dense layer can be a hidden layer, a hidden layer doesn't have to be a dense layer; it could be any type of layer that processes the input before passing it to the output.
